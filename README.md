## Portfolio

This repository is for an online resume/portfolio for the work of J. Nathaniel Smith. Much of the early work will be projects related to Code Louisville course work.

Ignore all files containing the word "test". These are not acutal project files, but test files uploaded to help learn Git and GitHub.
