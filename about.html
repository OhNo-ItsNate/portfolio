                    <h3>About</h3>
                    <p>Growing up, I was always driven to create. Drawing, making comic books, and building my own creations with legos were among my earliest creative pursuits. As I got older, I developed a passion for music that continues to this day and can be seen in two of my portfolio pieces.</p>
                    <p>It was my sophmore year of high school when I got my first taste of HTML. I would spend hours outside of class coding a GeoCities website. I played and built pages as I did when I was a kid playing with legos. It was truthfully a confusing mess of a site, but it helped me learn the basics of HTML.</p>
                    <p>It wouldn't be until a decade later that I would pick up where I left off in learning web development. In that time, HTML changed and added new, convenient features, but the basics were the same. The biggest difference was this little thing called CSS, and it completely changed my life. Prior to learning CSS, I was inserting styling into HTML tags with attributes like bgcolor and alink, vlink, etc. I felt a greater sense of enpowerment with these amazing tools.</p>
                    <p>Today, having added JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, and Git to my repertoire, the sky is the limit! It is my sincere hope that I can not only take what I have learned and make a living doing it, but to ensure that the internet is an accessible place, where no one is left out.</p>
